ws-server WebSocket Service
This directory contains the Node.js WebSocket server for the analyser_python project (different repo). The service is designed to be deployed on platforms like Render and can be easily adapted for other cloud or on-premise environments.

Features
WebSocket server for real-time communication

Built with Node.js and the ws library

Easily configurable for different deployment platforms

Designed for integration with the Excel Sheet Analyser ecosystem

Repository Structure
Repository:
https://github.com/SakethVetcha/Excel_Sheet_Analyser

Root Directory for Server:
ws-server/

Main Entry Point:
server.js

Branch:
main

Deployment (Render Example)
This service is already configured for deployment on Render. Below are the key settings and steps for deploying or adapting to other platforms:

Build & Deploy Settings
Setting	Value/Instruction
Repository	https://github.com/SakethVetcha/Excel_Sheet_Analyser
Branch	main
Root Directory	ws-server
Build Command	yarn install
Start Command	node server.js
Git Credentials: Use your own or the provided account.

Build Filters: Configure included/ignored paths as needed for your workflow.

Environment Variables
If your server requires environment variables (e.g., for ports, secrets), set them in your Render dashboard or .env file.

Local Development
Navigate to the server directory:

bash
cd ws-server
Install dependencies:

bash
yarn install
Start the server:

bash
node server.js
The server will listen on the configured port (default: 8080 or as set in your code).

Example WebSocket Usage
Below is a minimal example of how the server might be structured (see your actual server.js for details):

js
const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', ws => {
  ws.on('message', message => {
    console.log('received:', message);
    // Handle incoming messages
  });
  ws.send('WebSocket server connected');
});
Adapting for Other Platforms
Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.:
Use the same build and start commands. Adjust environment variables and port settings as required by your platform.

Monorepo Support:
The ws-server directory can be used as the root for deployment, ensuring only relevant code is built and deployed.

Notes
Auto-Deploy:
Changes to files inside ws-server/ will trigger auto-deploys if configured in your platform.

Testing:
Use WebSocket clients (e.g., Postman, websocat, browser tools) to connect and test your server.

Dependencies:
Ensure ws and any other required packages are listed in package.json.
